HI Team GOFR !

This is basic To-Do list APP with ability to perform CRUD operation.

The go server makes connection to MongoDB Atlas(a cloud NO-SQL DBMS) via connection URL.

The server has necessary routing to handele all put,post,delete,update requests via respective function.

I have attached the project screenshots for your reference.

This assignment/mini-project was really challenging and fruitful as i learnt a new server side language by Google
which is in demand in today's world.

Thanks for this opportunity and considering my application.


To run this project open 2 terminals

terminal 1. cd into serve2 and -> go run main.go
terminal 2. cd into client and -> npm run start

server runs on port 8080
and client on port 3000
